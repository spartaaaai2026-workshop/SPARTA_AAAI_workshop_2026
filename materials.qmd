### We welcome:

1.Original research: Technical advances in cross-modal modeling (e.g., joint embeddings, causal inference and biological reasoning).  
2.Applications: Demonstrations of spatial–imaging integrated AI in drug discovery.  
3.Resources: New datasets, challenges, benchmarks, or best-practice infrastructures.  
4.Position and survey papers: Reviews of barriers and opportunities in multi-modal therapeutic AI.


### Outcomes & Vision

•Establish a community hub for spatial‑imaging AI in disease understanding, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.  
•Plan for a public benchmark challenge for multi-modal therapeutic prediction.  
•Initiate discussions on a white paper summarizing consensus on data standards, ethical considerations, and research directions.  
•Inspire follow-up collaborations—from joint grant proposals to shared toolkits
